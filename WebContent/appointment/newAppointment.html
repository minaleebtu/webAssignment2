        <p>Doctors and nurses see patients by appointment throughout the day. You can make an appointment by sending a mail, or calling in at reception.</p> 
        <p>If your problem is urgent, we will see you as soon as possible. We aim to give you an appointment with a doctor or nurse of your choice within a week.</p>
		<p>If you feel that you need more time than usual with a doctor or a nurse, please ask for a DOUBLE APPOINTMENT when you make an appointment.</p>
		<p>Please note that we operate the following appointment lengths:
			<ul class="applength">
			<li>Doctors - 10 minutes</li>
			<li>Nurses - 15 minutes</li>
			</ul>
		Booking the right appointment length and arriving on time will help surgeries run smoothly.</p>

		<h1>PATIENTS ARRIVING MORE THAN 10 MINUTES LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT MAY NOT BEEN SEEN Extended Opening Hours for Pre-Booked Appointments Only</h1>
		<p>Doctors offer extended hours appointments on alternate Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Early appointments start at 7am and late appointments start at 18:00 and run to 20:00. Pre-booked appointments are also available on Saturday mornings from 8:30 to 11:40.
		In addition to our regular extended opening hours, from December 2013 you will also be able to book to see a nurse for certain types of appointment on alternate Saturday mornings. Please ask Reception for details.
		Pre-booked appointments with nurses are also available on alternate Tuesday and Wednesday evenings between 18:00 â€“ 20:00.</p>
		<p>Our healthcare assistant can offer early blood appointments on alternate Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from 07:50.</p>
		
		<h2>Urgent Appointments</h2>
		<p>Please phone as early in the day as possible and advise that it is urgent. You may be assessed by our primary care nurse to determine the urgency. You will be booked with the first available doctor.
		In an emergency always call <h2>000</h2></p>

		<h3>Telephone Advice</h3>
		<p>Many issues do not need a face to face consultation and can be dealt with over the telephone and you can request a telephone consultation. At times of heavy demand when there is no appointment available to meet your request you will be offered a telephone appointment. If the doctor feels that you need to be seen they will arrange a time for you to come in to the practice.
		This service is offered each morning. The doctor will call you back in the order that requests are received.</p>
