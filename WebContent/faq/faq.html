        <div class="panel-body" id="q1_1">
          <p>In order to make an appointment, please use our <a href="../appointment/newAppointment.html">appointment form.</a> You can submit the document via email. On the basis of the information received our physicians will be able to provide you with a good-quality treatment offer. If you wrote wrong information and already sent it, please print and give the corrected document to us when you visit our hospital. Also, be aware of the cases that our physicians additionally need some medical documents.</p>
          <p>We require copies of the following medical documents to enable us to provide treatment offers and the cost estimate:
			<ul>
				<li>Mandatory: latest medical report (not older than 3 months; hematology cases: not older than 1 month)</li>
				<li>Imaging technique results</li>
				<li>Laboratory results</li>
				<li>Oncology patients: histology report, treatment plans/radiation treatment protocols of previous treatments</li>

				<li>up-to-date (not older than 3 months; hematology cases: not older than 3 weeks)</li>
				<li>informative (for example: current status of the patient, last treatment, principal diagnosis and further conditions) and</li>

  					<div onclick="showOnClick('q1_3')" class="panel-title">What should I take into account when sending my medical documents? Will my documents be returned to me?	</div>
						<div class="panel-body" id="q1_3">
  							<p>You will find notes on the required documents on first question. Medical documents in common formats (e.g. pdf, jpeg, word) can be attached to the email; for DICOM image data, for example MRI or CT images, we have a DICOM upload portal (Telemedicine Portal) available – you can upload image data either immediately after sending the form or later using the upload-link we will provide to your e-mail address. When you use these upload options we will have immediate access to your data and can process your inquiry as fast as possible (no mailing delays).</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can send a CD/DVD (images in DICOM format) by mail to:&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee that your documents will be returned to you and therefore ask you to provide us with copies only and not original documents.</p>

  						<p>First of all, you should be noticed that you may not be able to meet a doctor or get a treatment when you want without sending document. You may wait for a long time. When you visit our hospital without making an appointment, you should write a form but it would take a time. We always recommend to fill the document before you come in. <br>If you feel hard to use the web site, you can also call us to meet the doctor. But please understand that we need time to get your call because we are getting many call. If you have further questions, <a href="mailto: GCH@GCH.de">email</a> &nbsp;to us.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>As soon as your payment is credited to the Grand Cottbus Hospital account, we will communicate your appointment to you. As a matter of principle, you will be offered the soonest possible appointment or your preferred date, if possible. The soonest available appointment is usually about 1 - 8 weeks following payment receipt; in rare cases, a time period of more than 8 weeks may elapse between payment receipt and the soonest available appointment. </p>

							<p>The treatment guarantee submitted to us is respectively limited to a time period and to a specific treatment. Should the submitted treatment guarantee not cover</p><ul><li>the treatment period or</li><li>the planned treatment which is not associated with the primary treatment or</li><li>the costs for the travelling companion</li></ul><p>you will be requested to prepay the planned extension of the treatment / admission of a travelling companion or to submit an extended treatment guarantee; please understand that the costs must be guaranteed in good time prior to your appointment.</p>

	        <div class="panel-body" id="q2_4">
							<p>For some countries, international outgoing financial transactions are not possible (e.g. due to political situation). For this reason, some patients transfer the requested prepayments though third party accounts. In this case, please note that this is on personal own risk and a proof of the ownership (e.g. receipt) should be kept.</p>
              <p>As a rule, refunds can only be transferred to the account the payment was made. A refund to a different account (e.g. your own / consulate) is only possible from our side after receipt of a proper proof of ownership of the transferred money (e.g. receipt, transfer confirmation, written declaration/power of attorney from the third party etc.).</p>

Patients looking to hire a certified interpreter or with questions, e.g. about the standard rates for interpreters / other assistance services, may contact our office. Our staff can help to find an interpreter. </p>
